        <h1>Integrity Solutions Make Installer</h1>
        <p>This Wizard will guide you through creating an installer for your
           project. Follow the steps to provide all of the information that is
           needed in order for your installer wizard to be generated.</p>
        
        <h2>Navigating the Wizard</h2>
        <p>Navigate through this Wizard by clicking on the <u>N</u>ext and 
            <u>B</u>ack buttons, as needed. You will only be able to move to the
            next step once all <strong>required</strong> information in the 
            current step is provided. Until then, the <u>N</u>ext button will be
            disabled.</p>
        
        <h2>Completing the Wizard</h2>
        <p>Once you have provided all required information, you will be taken to
            a <em>Summary</em> page. On this page, you can review the information
            you provided. If you need to make changes, simply click the 
            <u>B</u>ack button to return to the step where the change(s) needs
            to be made and make the change. Once everything is set up the way
            you would like it, click on the <u>F</u>inish button to complete the
            Wizard and generate your Installer Wizard. This task may take some
            time to complete, as your Installer Wizard will be compiled from
            generated source code files and <code>JAR</code>chived into an 
            executable <code>JAR</code> file for deployment. You can monitor the
            progress via the progress indicator on the <em>Completing Task</em>
            page. The more complex your desired Installation Wizard, the longer
            the generation task will take, so, please be patient.</p>
