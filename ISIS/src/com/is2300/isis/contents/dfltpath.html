        <h1>Default Installation Path</h1>
        <p>On this step, you need to enter the default installation location for
            your application. Typically, on Windows&trade;, this would be in 
            either the &quot;Program Files&quot; (for 64-bit software) or, 
            &quot;Program Files(86)&quot; (for 32-bit software). On Linux, this
            can either be in the &quot;/usr/&quot; or the "&quot;/usr/local/&quot;
            folder. However, the user can also choose to have the default install
            location be in their home folder: &quot;C:\Users\UserName\&quot; on
            Windows&trade;; or &quot;/home/userName/&quot; on Linux systems.</p>
        
        <p>You may select from the list of environment variables by selecting the
            checkbox, then choosing which environment variable to use for your
            default install location. If a location meeting your needs does not
            appear in this list, simply uncheck the checkbox and manually enter
            the path into which you wan your software installed.</p>
