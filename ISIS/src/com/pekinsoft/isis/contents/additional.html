        <h1>Additional JAR Files</h1>
        <p>On this step, you may select additional JAR files that your project
           may require. If they are all in the same folder, you can select all
           of them at once, contiguously, by selecting the first file, holding
           down the &lt;Shift&gt; key while clicking on the last file. If you
           need to select non-contiguous files, hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key
           while clicking on each file that you need.</p>
        <p>If you need JAR files from multiple folders, you may add each one
           individually by clicking on the &quot;Select Additional Jar Files&quot;
           button to select each additional file.</p>
        
        <h2>Library Files</h2>
        <p>If your project requires additional libraries, such as the Apache
           Derby JAR for database access, You will select them on the next step.
