# So You Want to Contribute...
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project. **AND** *anyone* means ***ANYONE***! We don't care what skill level you are at or how you
would like to help out. From the time I was a little child, my grandmother always said, "Many hands make for light work." I couldn't agree
with that sentiment more if I tried.

Now that you know you are welcome here, how would you like to help out? We can use people who know, or want to learn, how to program in the
Java:tm: Programming Lanugage. We can use people who speak different languages to translate everything for us. We can use people who like 
to write to create the documentation for the end-users. We can use financial support, if you would like to do that. However, you would like
to help out, just [drop us a line](mailto:sean@carricktrucking.com) and let us know.

## Programmers
We are writing this project in the Java:tm: language and can always use help with various tasks. Ideas we are kicking around are:
* Creating an "IDE" type of interface to allow for easy customization of installer wizards.
* Compiling custom installer wizards on the fly.
* A lot of other ideas that haven't even come to us yet.

## Translators
Since we only speak English, we could use help making this project go international. We can always use people that speak English fluently, 
as well as at least one other lanugage semi-fluently, or at least conversationally, to translate everything within the project.

## Document Writers
We would love to have solid on-line help available to the end users. Furthermore, we'd love to have anyone who writes documentation work
with anyone who is translating so that all documentation will be available in every language that the program is available in.

## Financial Support
Though often overlooked, this is one of the most important contributions an Open Source project can receive. People typically don't think 
about the fact that Open Source developers have the same living expenses as everyone else, but their work is mostly done for free, which is
then available to everyone to use, modify and redistribute. Please, if you feel drawn to do so, help us eat.
